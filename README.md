# UnderstandingTheLayersOfLLMs


Section 3:
We can see that with the increase in number of the layers in the model we see some changes to the numbers. The numbers are linear meaning that the model is able to perform better as the layers increase, thereby giving us a better score as the increase in layers.
**Results for different layers used **
